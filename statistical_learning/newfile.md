# Statistical Learning
This demo is written fully in Python 3 using pygame and tkinter. It is a demonstration of statistical learning using nonsense syllables modeled after Saffran, Aslin, and Newport (1996).
Included in the demo is one Python module and nine sound files. The sound files were originally created by Carla Hudson Kam and consist of one 2 minute audio file for training and eight short (< 1 minute) test files. These files are stored under a folder named demo audio.
